Hello! My name is Luba and I am junior front-end developer!

Since I was a kid, I have always enjoyed solving math problems (especially logic problems).
That is why after school I entered the university at the mathematics faculty, specializing in applied mathematics. So I am a mathematical programmer by education.

In my final year of university, I started working as a programmer in a company specializes in development, distribution, publishing and support of mass-market software. I was engaged in the development of software for payroll and HR administration both for individual projects and independent projects that could be used by any organization. For 15 years I have worked my way from a junior programmer to the department chief. Based on my experience I can say that I am team player and strive to achieve my goals.

Now I decided to try something new. Why did I choose front-end development? Because it is very interesting! Thanks to developer's code, the user can buy a library card, order a coffee or play a game. It's a bit like magic! It is exciting to look how you can turn your knowledge into beautiful web application and interact with end user, wouldn't you agree? I like to see the result of my work, I like to learn something new all the time and I would like to grow in this industry in the future.

I started learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript one year ago. At first I studied everything on my own, and then I started studying at rsschool in the course "JavaScript/Front-end. Stage 0."
On stage 0 my final work [Shoot Bubble](https://zarembochka.github.io/stage0/random-game/) on Random game made it to the top 10 list. Now I am continuing my studies on the stage1 course.

I believe that my strengths: teamwork, responsibility, communication, time management, stress resistance, problem solving and analytical thinking â€” will allow me to succeed in the new path of my life.

Thank you for your attention!
